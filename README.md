# sandbox

## Welcome
Welcome to the Lingoport Sandbox. Use the sandbox to get a feel for Lingoport's
Globalyzer. You may commit Java, JavaScript or C# code under the relevant
folder. Once the code has been pushed to the repository, it will be
automatically scanned by Globalyzer. Within a couple of minutes, the results
will be shown on the sandbox dashboard, at [sandbox.lingoport.com](http://sandbox.lingoport.com).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
   * $ git clone https://github.com/sandboxLingoport/sandbox.git
2. Checkout the working branch
   * $ git checkout working
3. Add Java, JavaScript and/or C# code under the relevant directory.
4. Commit and push you changes
   * $ git add &lt;changed files here&gt;
   * $ git commit
   * $ git push origin working

Within a couple of minutes, the Lingoport Sandbox
[Dashboard](http://sandbox.lingoport.com) will update to include a scan of your changes.

## Notes

The 'working' branch will be reset on a weekly basis.
